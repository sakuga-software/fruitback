# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this
repository.

## Project

Fruitback is a visual feedback widget: a client clicks an element on their staging site, writes a
note, and it becomes a Linear issue carrying the CSS selector, the React component and the source
file. Coming back to the page, they see their pins again, coloured by Linear status.

**There is no Fruitback backend. Linear is the database.** The only server-side piece is a proxy
service that holds the Linear token. Anything that looks like it needs storage — status, threads,
assignees, history — belongs in Linear, not here. See [README.md](README.md) for the reasoning and
the alternatives that were dropped.

Deployment is **Docker on a VPS, driven by Dokploy from GitHub** — no Cloudflare, no serverless, no
managed platform primitives. When something needs infrastructure, reach for what a single container
behind Traefik can do.

## Commands

Package manager is `pnpm@11.16.0` (pinned). Nx runs multi-project targets.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test                                   # nx run-many -t test → node --test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint                                   # oxlint
pnpm format:fix                             # oxfmt

pnpm --filter @fruitback/shared test         # one package
pnpm --filter @fruitback/shared test:watch
node --test src/seed.test.ts                 # one file, from the package directory
```

## Layout

- `packages/shared` (`@fruitback/shared`) — the seed contract. Browser- and server-safe: no Node API,
  no DOM API beyond `URL`. Also exports `@fruitback/shared/seed.fixture`, so every package tests
  against the same seed instead of keeping a drifting copy.
- `apps/worker` (`@fruitback/worker`) — the Node service. `POST /feedback` is live; `GET /feedback`
  answers 501 until SKG-499. Still called "worker" because that is what everyone calls it, though it
  is no longer an edge worker.
- `packages/widget` — _not written yet._ Capture + overlay, on top of `react-grab/primitives`.

## The worker

- It exists for exactly one reason: the Linear API key cannot ship in client-side JS. Resist putting
  logic here that belongs in the widget or in Linear.
- **`app.ts` is transport-agnostic** — a `handleRequest(request, env, context)` over web
  `Request`/`Response`. `server.ts` adapts `node:http` onto it and `main.ts` starts it. Keep new
  behaviour in `app.ts` so it stays testable without opening a socket.
- The env is validated up front (`readConfig`), so a missing secret surfaces at boot and on
  `/health`, not as an opaque Linear error per request.
- `POST /feedback` re-canonicalizes `seed.page.url` server-side. The read path finds seeds by
  matching that URL inside the description, so a client that skipped normalization would plant a pin
  nobody can find again.
- Failure codes are deliberate: `400` the caller's fault, `403` origin not allowed, `413` oversized
  body, `429` rate-limited, `500` misconfigured, `502` Linear unavailable (the widget should keep the
  note and retry). `/health` answers `503` when misconfigured so a bad deploy is never routed to.
- **`resolveClientIp` is security-relevant.** `X-Forwarded-For` is appended to by each proxy, so the
  left of the chain is caller-controlled and forgeable; the client IP is the entry
  `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` from the **right**. Reading the leftmost entry — correct behind Cloudflare,
  wrong behind Traefik — makes the rate limit bypassable with one header.
- The rate limiter is in-process, therefore **per replica**. Scaling to N containers multiplies the
  effective ceiling by N; a shared store is the fix if that ever matters.
- Tests drive `handleRequest` with plain `Request` objects against a stubbed Linear
  (`linear-stub.ts`); no container needed. The assertion that matters most is that the stored
  description parses back into the exact seed that was posted.
- `reporter` in an incoming seed is **client-asserted and unverified** — do not treat it as identity
  until SKG-498 lands.

## The seed contract

`packages/shared` is the contract both ends depend on. Treat changes to it as breaking.

- A **seed** is one pin: `note`, `page`, `viewport`, `anchor`, plus optional `source` (react-grab),
  `client`, `reporter`, `env`, `screenshot`.
- **The round-trip is the invariant**: `parseSeedFromDescription(buildIssueDescription(seed))` must
  return exactly `seed`. Two rules protect it — **no schema default values**, and no field the
  widget cannot rebuild from what is stored. Adding a default is the easy way to break this
  silently; the test `adds no field the caller did not provide` is there to catch it.
- **Bump `SEED_VERSION`** when the payload shape changes. Readers accept older versions and refuse
  newer ones (`unsupported-version`) rather than silently dropping fields.
- **`parseSeed*` never throws.** It returns `{ ok: false, reason }` — the input is a Linear
  description a human may have edited.
- `canonicalizePageUrl` is the page identity: fragment and tracking params dropped, remaining params
  sorted. It must stay idempotent, and its output must appear verbatim in the description — that is
  what makes the Linear `description: { contains: … }` filter work.
- Pin colour comes from `stageForLinearState` (Linear workflow state type → fruit stage). The widget
  never stores a status of its own.

## Conventions

- Formatting and linting are oxfmt / oxlint (config at the root). 120 columns, single quotes,
  trailing commas.
- **Tests run on `node:test` and `node:assert/strict`** — no test runner, no transpiler, no loader.
  `pnpm test` is `node --test 'src/**/*.test.ts'`; Node strips the types itself. Colocated as
  `*.test.ts`, fixtures in `*.fixture.ts`.
  - `assert.equal` / `assert.deepEqual` from `node:assert/strict` are the strict variants — no need
    for `strictEqual`.
  - Partial matching is `assert.partialDeepStrictEqual`. There is no `expect.arrayContaining`; assert
    the exact array, or narrow first with `assert.ok(result.ok)` and then compare.
  - Doubles come from `node:test`'s `mock` (`mock.method(globalThis, 'fetch', …)`), restored with
    `mock.restoreAll()` in an `afterEach`.
- **Relative imports carry the `.ts` extension.** Node's ESM resolver requires it, and that is what
  lets `node --test` and `node --watch src/main.ts` run the sources with no build step. `tsc` accepts
  it through `allowImportingTsExtensions`, which is why both tsconfigs set `noEmit`.
- `packages/shared` keeps `types: []` on purpose — it is bundled into a browser widget, so touching
  `process` or `Buffer` must fail to compile. Its tests need Node types, so they typecheck through a
  separate `tsconfig.test.json`; do not "fix" this by adding `node` to the main config.
- Comments explain _why_, not _what_ — the tolerant parser and the redundant anchor both exist for
  reasons that are not obvious from the code.
- Work is tracked in Linear on the
  [Fruitback](https://linear.app/sakuga-software/project/fruitback-ed574263d8d6) project (team SKG).

## Linear MCP

The Linear MCP server is declared in [.mcp.json](.mcp.json) at the project scope. If its tools are
missing in a session, it needs to be approved and authorized (`/mcp` in an interactive session) —
it cannot be authorized from a non-interactive one.
