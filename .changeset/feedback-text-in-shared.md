The worker serves `POST /mcp`, a remote MCP server for an AI agent with an agent key of a workspace: `list_feedback`, `get_feedback` and `feedback_as_text` read the notes of the sites of the key, with their whole content. `@fruitback/shared` exports `feedbackText`, the plain text of the notes of a page that « Copy as text » writes, with the words given by the caller. `feedbackAsText` of the widget answers the same text as before.
