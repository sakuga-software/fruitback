A reply can say `by: 'agent'`: an AI agent wrote it through `/mcp`, with an agent key of the workspace. The field is optional, and a widget that does not read it shows the name of the reply alone. The worker gives an agent key with the right `write` two tools, `reply_to_feedback` and `set_feedback_status`, limits each key to 30 writes a minute, and keeps a log of the writes of each key, which the owner and the admins read in the console API.
