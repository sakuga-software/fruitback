`@fruitback/shared` exports the messages between the console and the extension of the same browser: `EXTERNAL_VERSION`, `EXTERNAL_TYPES`, the types `ExternalAsk` and `ExternalAnswer`, the lists `EXTERNAL_CONNECT_STATES` and `EXTERNAL_REFUSALS`, and `parseExternalAnswer`. The console reads each answer of the extension through it in place of casts, and the extension answers with the same types. The messages themselves do not change.
